**Value:** `production`

**Variable Name:** `MONGODB_URI`

After setting these variables, your app should start successfully and the 500 errors should be resolved.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:

1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure there are no extra spaces in the variable values
